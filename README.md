I tried to create an assembler program that takes an error-free Hack assembly language code file and generates its corresponding binary code.
A window opens, asking you to drag and drop a .txt file into it. The file you drop should contains the error free assembly code. The program reads that code, converts it to binary, and writes the resulting binary codes into a new .txt file created in the same folder as the source file.
If the output file already exists, it overwrites it.
